bad-policy-slice:Distribution policy "{0}" has returned invalid slice \
	"{1}" for "{2}". The valid slices are {3}. This error may happen \
	when one or more of the originally configured slices are unavailable \
	and Lenient property is set to true.
no-policy-slice:Distribution policy "{0}" has returned no slice for "{1}". \
	The valid slices are {2}.
forced-set-config: Configuration property "{0}" is not set explicitly. Setting \
	this value to "{1}".
multithreaded-false: Configuration property "{0}" is set to "false". \
	It is recommended to set "{0}" to "true", because Slice executes database \
	operations per slice in parallel in different threads, setting "{0}" to \
	"false" may cause unpredictable behavior.
unknown-impl-data: Encountered unrecognized internal data "{0}" of "{1}" \
	associated with persistent instance "{2}".
